A simple blog built during Web Development course on Udacity, hosted in webdev-ud.appspot.com

Right now, it allows anyone to register and post, since it was necessary for the grading bot to test the app.

It uses Google App Engine with Python (Jinja2 framework). Bootstrap 3 for styling. 

The app was built for learning purposes and it has a json API and uses memcache.
